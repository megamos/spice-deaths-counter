## Spice-deaths Counter

**http://cryptic-spire-9877.herokuapp.com/**

**A site that counts the number of people killed or hospitalized from the synthetic drug Spice.**

*As I'm just starting to learn Rails, I'd love some help getting this site up and out there asap.*

### Features

* Death counter
* Hospitalized counter (if possible to get a somewhat right number)
* *Victims:* Name/Age/City/Country/Link(info/newspaper) of all victims
* *Links:* Any kind of "learn more" information about the topic

#### Things that needs to be done before launch

* Fix the header. (Styles, pics and maybe some more info)
* Add admin features to edit and remove links/victims
* Better validations
* Maybe adding "order by vote" to links
* Sorting Victims by Country then Name
* #Show page for every Victim with more info
* **Adding all the Victims**

##### Thoughts

Let's fuel the fire of today's debate about the dangers of the (somewhat) legal drug spice.
Many young people don't want to break the law. Instead of smoking cannabis they buy Spice.
I feel lucky not to be one of those that never woke up after.
